# Daily And Sports activities 
A Data Analytics project using pandas and sklearn where we try to create a model based on raw data of sensors on muscles during sevrals activities.
Given the differents sensors's inputs, we try to predict what exercice a person is doing.
A project in collaboration with my classmate made as an assignement for the "Data Analytics and Data Driven Decision" course in University of L'Aquila.
